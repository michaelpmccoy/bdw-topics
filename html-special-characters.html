<h1> Mike McCoy: html special characters </h1>

  <h2>Article 1: Special Characters by Webmonkey Staff</h2>
  <h2><a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/special_characters/">web monkey article</a></h2>

    <h3>This one is so short, it barely qualifies as an article or blog post. But it caught my eye since it&rsquo;s affiliated with Wired, which I try to read monthly. It looks to be mainly a list of characters and their corresponding HTML codes. It&rsquo;s the first place I&rsquo;ve heard mention of the ISO Latin-1 table, which will probably come in handy at some point. It doesn&rsquo;t really offer a whole lot more info, but I bookmarked it for future reference. This webmonkey site actually looks to be a pretty badass resource. Lots of tutorials and cheat sheets and stuff. I&rsquo;m glad I stumbled on it, because I bet I&rsquo;ll get more use out of it as we get further into the class.</h3>

  <h2>Article 2: HTML Special Characters by Neal Chester</h2>

    <h3>This looks to be more of a self promo blog than an article. But it looks like a helpful resource of actual special characters and their html equivalents, as well as a few  paragraphs about how to use them.  This guy styled and curated a bunch of his most commonly used special characters and put them in one place, available to others to use. Very cool. I like how the web dev community does stuff like this, similar to the graphic design community and free vector art, fonts, plugins, etc. It seems a bit backwards to start the blog post with all the codes, and then include his write ups at the bottom of the page. But, hey, who am I to complain when he&rsquo;s taking the time to make this stuff available for everyone. It&rsquo;s cool that he grouped them into HTML, CSS and JS, also. He gives you the UTF&#45;8 code to drop in (which I remember hearing about in our first class.) And he explains how you should plug it in for both HTML and CSS. He also mentions that sometimes they don&rsquo;t render properly across all browsers, so you need to cross check it yourself to be sure. This stuff will probably make more sense to me in a few months, once I&rsquo;ve gotten my hands dirty a bit. But I understand it in principle right now. </h3>
