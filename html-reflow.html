<h1> Mike McCoy: HTML Reflow </h1>

  <h2>Article 1: The Cost of Reflows on a Web App by Daniel Pfeiffer</h2>
  <h2><a href="http://floatlearning.com/2011/06/the-cost-of-reflows-on-a-web-app/">floatlearning.com the cost of reflows article</a></h2>

    <h3>This article focuses on mobile web and apps created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and how reflow comes into play with them. The explain that when the page displays, reflow starts happening right then. They describe it as the content being affected by the stylesheet and the page&rsquo;s layout dimensions that have been established. Once this technical stuff occurs in the background, it results in the pixel data being displayed appropriately. Performance and render speed can be an issue here when the reflow is occuring. And this performance can be an even bigger issue on mobile, where the reflow process can be considerably slower. They get into some of the HTML5 semantics that we've discussed and used in class, but the author feels that these semantics need to be secondary to the HTML being lean and efficient for mobile. I&rsquo;m honestly not sure why semantics wouldn&rsquo;t help with that efficiency. I thought that is what it was there for, to help in ordering and browser recognition. I guess he thinks some tags are unnesessary and too long. But apparently that stuff makes the reflow take longer, which makes the app feel slow. The author also gives a few tips on styling content so that you only need to trigger one reflow instead of multiples, cutting down on time. His basic summary is that mobile needs to be more efficient than desktop, and some compromises need to occur to ensure that. </h3>

  <h2>Article 2: Minimizing browser reflow by Lindsey Simon</h2>
  <h2><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/reflow">Google Developers browser reflow article</a></h2>

    <h3>This is a much better article for someone of my inexperience. The author breaks things down into more simplified language. They explain some of the basic principles of reflow and then get into some suggested best practices. They define reflow as the browser&rsquo;s process for recalculating positions of elements in the document when re-rendering it. They explain why it&rsquo;s important ford developers to improve reflow time and the effect that certain properties can have on that speed. They explain what can trigger a reflow, including resizing the browser windo and using certain JavaScript elements. This part was similar to the last article, but more clearly stated. They even include a graphic chart to illustrate their point. Some of their suggestions, like DOM alterations, were over my head in the specifics, but I at least understood the main concept. Minimizing CSS rules and eliminating unused CSS rules is another concept I can understand, even without hands-on experience. Their other suggestions were over my head, but it all goes back to simplification of what&rsquo;s necessary and elimination of what&rsquo;s not. And that&rsquo;s a solid principle for any well-functioning machine that needs to run efficiently and simply. The article concludes with a nice, short video recap by the author. Very good article all around. I&rsquo;ll be coming back here for more knowledge.</h3>
