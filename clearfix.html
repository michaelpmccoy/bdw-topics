<h1> Mike McCoy: Clearfix </h1>

  <h2>Article 1: The New Clearfix Method by Jeff Starr</h2>
  <h2><a href="http://perishablepress.com/new-clearfix-hack/">perishable press clearfix article</a></h2>

    <h3>This post explains how in the older days, the process of clearfixing was more of a hack to clear floats. I had to read up on this a bit more to refresh my memory on what this entails. With a refresher from css-tricks.com, I know that it addresses the problem of floated objects not adding to the height of the object they reside in. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I understand this concept based on our class discussion from last week. But honestly, sometimes I wish these blog posts would use less tech jargon. Chalk that up to my own ineptitude, I guess. Back to the article. The author says that the hack was a result of older browsers, so now there is a more efficient way in CSS to deal with it. He gives some sample code to demonstrate. He says that the newer versions of Internet Explorer support the new method, but for older IE browsers, it&rsquo;ll trigger an action that uses proprietary CSS. But that the new way will clear floats in currently used browsers without the old hack. So that sounds like good progress. This article was maybe too heavily focused on IE. But from my days dealing with a dinosaur client whose internal marketing department still all had old, random versions of IE installed (barf), I totally get it.</h3>

  <h2>Article 2: CSS Tip: A Better Clearfix with Sass by Guil Hernandez</h2>
  <h2><a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/a-better-clearfix-with-sass">treehouse blog clearfix article</a></h2>

    <h3>In this article, the author covers similar ground as the previous article. He talks about the CSS clearfix being a necessary tool for float based layouts. He also discusses new, more efficient ways to clear floats using something called Sass. He explains that nesting isn't the most efficient way to clear floats because there's excessive CSS output needed, resulting in too much code size. He brings up the concept of a Mixin, and gives some sample code to illustrate his point. But he explains that even that method results in extra code, or extra CSS. He gives an alternative method that results in less CSS for larger projects and proceeds to give some sample code for that method. He also gets into creating placeholder selectors, so that nothing gets compiled to CSS unless it is used. His summary is that the @extend option is more efficient, which is good for CSS, and that it is his suggested approach. </h3>
