<h1> Mike McCoy: Float Collapse </h1>

  <h2>Article 1: How Do You Keep Parents of Floated Elements From Collapsing</h2>
  <h2><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/218760/how-do-you-keep-parents-of-floated-elements-from-collapsing">stack overflow float collapse article</a></h2>

    <h3>This is more of a user forum site where questions and answers are posted, but it has some good content. It expains the concept of floated elements sometimes resulting in the parent elements collapsing. The original author posts snippets of code to illustrate the problem, and the solution. They actually provide several solutions. There are pros and cons involved. These include floating the parent, which would result in floating every ancestor element. Also, they suggest giving the parent an explicit height, appending a spacer element inside the parent element, and setting the parent to overflow: auto. Giving the parent an explicit height sounds like a good option, since it&rsquo;s semantic code that doesn&rsquo;t involve a layout hack, so it sounds like a clean, orderly way to solve the problem. </h3>

  <h2>Article 2: The Mystery of the CSS Float Property by Louis Lazaris</h2>
  <h2><a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/10/19/the-mystery-of-css-float-property/">smashing magazine css float article</a></h2>

    <h3>The author gives some background history on the float property issue, explaining how elements in columns wouldn&rsquo;t line up by each other, so the property started getting overused. The CSS float property let developers have table columns in HTML layouts. I appreciate this author wording things for a beginner to understand. This is less jargon and insider speak than the previous article, which helps me a lot. He gets into the float property, browser issues and how it is still used today. The author summarizes the float property as pushing a block-level element to the left or right, taking it out of the flow. Simple. I get that. Again, props to the author. He even relates it to the print world, for better or worse. Helped me to visualize things. He explains how float properties can have the value of left, right, none or inherit. And gives some code as an example. Smashing magazine is awesome. Great writing style for beginners to understand. He says that a floated element should have an explicitly set width, so it doesn&rsquo;t act funky in different browers. He illustrates what can happen with different behaviors assigned. He also get into clearing floats with the CSS clear property, and the issues that happen in different browsers. He explains the Collapsed Parent issue, which I learned a bit about in the first article. Good reinforcement. He runs through a few other solutions to the problem that people have used, and he also brings up Internet Explorer. Guess that really is a big issue. He even touches on JavaScript fixes for floats. Then he shows a few commonly-encountered errors to look out for, with images illustrating them. This article was much better than the first. It was easier for me to understand, and gave better real world examples and illustrations to help me visualize what was being discussed. </h3>
