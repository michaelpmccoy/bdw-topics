<h1> Mike McCoy: Box Sizing </h1>

  <h2>Box Sizing/h2>
  <h2><a href="http://css-tricks.com/box-sizing/">css-tricks.com box sizing</a></h2>

    <h3>This article is pretty great, since it not only includes a good write up on box sizing, but includes some visual diagrams and a demo to help demonstrate it. Which is good, since it sounds like the rules involving height and width as affected by border and padding have been treated somewhat differently in older browser versions. But it then goes on to explain the new way block elements work with defaults and no need for special CSS. IT sounds like this new box sizing element is something that people have been wanting for a while, and results in less hassle. </h3>

  <h2>Article 2: Take Control of the Box Model with box-sizing</h2>

    <h3>This article is more casually written, in true blog style, and geared towards a beginner level. They start out by simply explaining the old box model, with the border and padding factored into the total width and height of the box, and then they explain the benefits of the new box-sizing property in relation to fixed and fluid sizes, and how they are drawn outside the box. Which makes sense to me, with the box treated as the true content. They, too, include some visuals to help explain how it now dynamically reacts. So it leads to more flexibility and less math to remember to consider.</h3>
