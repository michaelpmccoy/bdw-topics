<h1> Mike McCoy: HTML5 Document Outline </h1>

  <h2>Article 1: HTML5 and the Document Outlining Algorithm by Derek Johnson</h2>
  <h2><a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/16/html5-and-the-document-outlining-algorithm/">smashing magazine article</a></h2>

    <h3>The author in this article covers the topic of sectioning content, and focuses on four ways to do that: by section, article, aside and nav. The algorithm talk is a bit out of my depth, but I can at least take away the concept of an outline being effected by how it&rsquo;s marked up, and how we can double check our work with the gsneddon outlining tool, just like we did in class. His visual illustrations of the code are clear and very helpful. He makes the difference of implicit and explicit sections clear, but the way he explains which ones can &rsquo;go into&rsquo; which, left me a bit confused. Probably something I won&rsquo;t remember until I actually just do it for myself a few times. He also does a nice job of clarifying how the sectioning content can create the outline properly, even if the headings seem out of order from how they were handled in HTML previously. Similar ground to what Mike Robinson&rsquo;s article covers. I still expect to use the H1 to H4 structure properly, like we discussed in class. But it&rsquo;s cool to see what can and can&rsquo;t be done with sectioning content. Like Robinson&rsquo;s article, he brings up untitled sections and how the outliner can help you see what needs to be fixed without screwing up the outline structure. I like how he wraps it up by saying, if you just remember the four basics of sectioning content that he started the article off with, you&rsquo;ll be well on your way. That, and to remember to use the outliner to check your work. That recap makes me feel better because by the end of the article, I was starting to feel stuffed to the gills with new terms.</h3>

  <h2>Article 2: Document Outlines by Mike Robinson</h2>
  <h2><a href="http://html5doctor.com/outlines/">html5 doctor article</a></h2>

    <h3>In this article, Mike Robinson talks about what makes for a good document outline. He defines it in layman&rsquo;s terms and explains how it can help users find information, as well as search engines to understand your content better. He makes the point several times that a big upgrade from the old HTML to the new is that the algorithm is now already defined in the spec. He explains how the old HTML worked, with the heading elements of h1 to h6, just like we learned about last week. But then he explains the new sectioning elements. Derek Johnson&rsquo;s article covered these as well, so it&rsquo;s starting to sound more familiar and sink in. He uses visual examples of his code, which is really helpful for me to see the differences he&rsquo;s covering. He explains sectioning elements and how they define the sections of the parent element. Just like the name implies. Makes sense.  It&rsquo;s funny how when you read the breakdown of how this stuff works, it all sounds logical and becomes demystified. But once I get overwhelmed by too many lines of stuff that looks and sounds the same, I&rsquo;m back to feeling like I&rsquo;m in over my head. hgroup is another concept touched on in the other article. The way he describes its use sounds logical. I like the logic and order and structure that&rsquo;s emphasized in these outlines. That&rsquo;s a concept I can understand and appreciate. Sounds like it might not stick around though. But this article is a few years old. Maybe I should&rsquo;ve chosen something more recent. Sectioning roots is another concept I remember reading about in Johnson&rsquo;s article. Lots to keep track of. He brings up the search engine crawlers, which I remember reading about in the Google SEO document. It&rsquo;s all coming together! To sum it up, this article&rsquo;s use of jargon still had me confused at times, but it&rsquo;s reinforcing concepts we learned about in class and concepts from our other readings, so it is starting to gel and gain traction in my mind, which is definitely worthwhile. </h3>
