    <h3>This white paper covers the basics of load balancing. It talks about Application Delivery Controllers and how load balancers help them. They cover basic terminology, such as Node, Host, Member and Server. It may seem rudimentary, but it helps to have some comfortable familiarity when learning something new. They break down how this basically means, are they talking to a physical server or an application that will receive traffic. They define Pools, Clusters and Farms, which seem to be interchangeable terms for the concept of a hosted collector for these services. They cover the basics of load balancing, such as how they decide which host will receive the requested connection. And how they monitor the health of the host to make sure the user will not have to wait. Good article that reinforced and clarified the concept for me. </h3>

They define load balancing aand how it can help manage traffic spikes that can hurt a network. They break down different sizes of organizations and their needs, like traffic management, security and connectivity, and how load balancing can help that out with solutions like hardware, software and virtual appliances. </h3>
