<h1> Mike McCoy: DOM Ndes </h1>

    <h3>This article talks about JavaScript and the DOM API. It might be a bit beyond a beginner level, but they have a nice breakdown of what a DOM is in one section. They define it as the Document Object Model, which is the API that JavaScript uses to interact with a website&rsquo;s content. This lets it access and affect the HTML. They include a graphic that shows a typical DOM outline. They also break down some of the typical types of nodes, like element, text and document. </h3>

  <h2>Article 2: Wikipedia DOM page</h2>
  <h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">Wikipedia DOM page</a></h2>

    <h3>To be honest, the first article I found was a bit over my head, so I retreated to the safety blanked of good old Wikipedia to help me understand the basics of DOM. I also thought it would help me apply it to HTML better, since the other article was so focused on JavaScript. The wiki page gives a similar definition for how it interacts with objects in HTML. It also gets into the concept of a DOM tree and how it&rsquo;s an API. Since it&rsquo;s Wikipedia, they get into the history of DOM and browsers. I focused on the implementation section. This page wasn&rsquo;t super helpful like I hoped it would be. I checked a few of my typical sites for these articles, but I didn&rsquo;t see any quality articles. Guess I&rsquo;ll need to keep my eyes peeled and do some future research once we discuss it more in class.</h3>
